# one pass prefix with hashmaps used for subarray problems
for two pointers i and j, prefix contains calculation of subarray from 0 to i while main loop has the total from subarray
0 to j where use the difference between [0,j] and [0,i] to find target. initialize prefix with 0:1 for single subarray matching cases
# reversing linked list problems
cycle of  (next -> head.next -> prev -> head -> next), set dummy node to mark the head of list where dummy.next = head
# sliding window
This technique shows how a nested for loop in some problems can be converted to a single for loop to reduce the time complexity.
# dfs backtracking
ex. 797 create helper recursive function, if condition is met at its depth return or append current list to ret. have a for loop that iterates all values
for current set of values and within the loop the recursive function is called on the next value
