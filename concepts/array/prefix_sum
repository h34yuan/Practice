# find subarrays with a sum/product etc. that is equal to some target t or is the min/max. One pass with 0 initially in prefix,
 keep a running tot and check prefix for difference every iteration,

# prefix stores the running total as the key and the index or number of occurrences.
930. Binary Subarrays With Sum
974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K
1546. Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target
523. Continuous Subarray Sum
152. Maximum Product Subarray
560. Subarray Sum Equals K

# equal number of values in contiguous subarray
525. Contiguous Array

# prefix used to find the number of elements to remove from array/list until target is met. prefix stores the index of the last occurring tot {presum tot: last seen index}
1590. Make Sum Divisible by P
1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List

1031. Maximum Sum of Two Non-Overlapping Subarrays
862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K
