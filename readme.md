# Interview Study Guide
Repo used to keep track of important concepts and algorithms needed for interviews. Questions are grouped 
into specific subtopics to allow for better understanding of repeated patterns. \
[Leetcode log](leetcode_log) stores all the previously completed questions by date along with tips and the chosen 
approach for each question.  

## Concepts and Samples:  
- Arrays:
    - [Array Lists](concepts/array/arrays.md)
    - [Prefix Sum](concepts/array/prefix_sum.md)
    - [Sliding Window](concepts/array/sliding_window.md)
    - [Two Pointer](concepts/array/two_pointer.md)

- [Backtrack](concepts/backtrack/backtrack.md)
- [Binary Search](concepts/binary_search/binary_search.md)
- [Dynamic Programming](concepts/dynamic_programming/dp.md)
- [Graphs](concepts/graphs/graphs.md)
- [Hashtable](concepts/hashtable/hashtable)
- [Heap](concepts/heap/heap.md)
- [Linked List](concepts/linked_lists/linkedlist.md)
- [Math](concepts/math/math)
- [Stack and Queue](concepts/stack_and_queue/stack_queue.md)
- Trees:

    - [Depth First Search](concepts/trees/dfs_tree.md)

## Leetcode Pattern Guide
```
If input array is sorted then
    - Binary search
    - Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
    - Backtracking

If given a tree then
    - DFS
    - BFS

If given a graph then
    - DFS
    - BFS
    - Union Find

If given a linked list then
    - Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
    - Stack

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
    - Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
    - Heap

If asked for common strings then
    - Map
    - Trie

Else
    - Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
    - Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
```
